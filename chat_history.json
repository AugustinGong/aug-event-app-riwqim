Guests scan the QR code to join the event (login required).\r\n4. **Event participation**: When the event is live, the organizer can send notifications like *\u201cAppetizer is coming\u201d*, *\u201cFirst course\u201d*, or *\u201cCake moment\u201d*. These trigger push notifications to all event participants.\r\n5. **Shared album**: All guests of an event can upload their photos to a shared album. Guests can view, download, and share photos uploaded by others. The organizer can moderate or delete photos.\r\n6. **Roles**: Organizer vs Guest. Organizer controls the event and notifications. Guests can only view and interact.\r\n7. **Privacy & security**: Only registered users and invited members (via QR code) can access an event. Photo storage must respect privacy and allow the organizer to disable downloads.\r\n\r\n**UI/UX requirements**:\r\n\r\n* Primary colors: **violet, white, light blue**.\r\n* None of the colors should dominate; use a clean, balanced palette.\r\n* Layout should be modern, minimal, with rounded cards, soft shadows, and plenty of white space.\r\n* Example screens:\r\n\r\n  * Onboarding/Login\r\n  * Event list (created and joined events)\r\n  * Event details with tabs: **Menu**, **Notifications**, **Album**, **QR/Invites**\r\n  * QR scanner (for joining events)\r\n  * Photo gallery with upload/download\r\n\r\n**Tech stack suggestion**:\r\n\r\n* **Frontend**: React Native (Expo, TypeScript)\r\n* **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions, FCM)\r\n* **QR codes**: `react-native-qrcode-svg` for generation, `expo-barcode-scanner` for scanning.\r\n* **Push notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging with event-based topics.\r\n\r\n**Extra**:\r\n\r\n* Organizers should have quick buttons to send course notifications (Appetizer, First, Second, Dessert, Cake).\r\n* Album photos should show who uploaded them.\r\n* Events and their albums should auto-expire after a set time (e.g., 180 days).\r\n\r\nThe final app should be production-ready, with smooth navigation, push notifications working out of the box, and a visually pleasing interface matching the violet/white/light blue theme."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand.
